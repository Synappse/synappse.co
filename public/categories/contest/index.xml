      <description>On the 22nd of the January, we have been a part UPC Think Big final gala which featured 10 of the contest finalists. We&amp;rsquo;ve been given an opportunity to bring closer our idea to the judges and answer their questions after 3min pitch.
Unfortunately we didn&amp;rsquo;t win but we had a great occasion to test our presentation skills and to check if this particular audience will know more about iBeacon technology - the answer apparently is not so much, more and more people start to know something or just they heard about Estimote company but still the understanding of iBeacons technology is very basic.</description>
