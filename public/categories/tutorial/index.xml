      <description>A while ago I&amp;rsquo;ve started working on a product that needed a multiplatform desktop app. I choose JavaFX as due to my research it will work the best with the other tools and frameworks that are necessary for this project.
Task In this post, I will show you how to build a custom vertical tab bar with icons using JFXTabPane. Our main goal over here is to create a side menu with 1 tab being single state logout button.</description>

      <description>Working with MapKit can be tricky but if you just need a preview of the map then MKMapSnapshotter comes with a helping hand.
MKMapSnapshotter which was introduced in iOS7 can not only simplify the code you are using to show some place&amp;rsquo;s location but also will greatly improve performance.
For more information on how and when to use MKMapSnapshotter take a look at WWDC 2013 Session 309: “Putting Map Kit in Perspective”.</description>

      <title>UIScrollView has an ambiguous scrollable content height</title>

      <description>This error showed to us by XCode means in plain English that scroll view is not able to determine its height (or width) using autolayout. There is a very simple solution to this problem and I will walk you thru it.
Our goal To illustrate how properly use scroll view with autolayout we will build a simple UIViewController with potentially (dynamically loaded) long text and button at the end of the view.</description>
