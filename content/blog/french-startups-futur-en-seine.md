At Synappse we're not **only** about creating stunning apps... we're also very interested in new technologies and start-up ecosystem, so we need to keep an eye on this field.
Besides everyday lecture of [The Verge](http://theverge.com), from time to time it's good to attend industry events, touch some amazing technologies and meet people face-to-face.

In the middle of June, I had an opportunity to visit Paris and see what's happening in local startups on the Futur en Seine event, where for 4 days over 100 exhibitors at _Innovation Village_ presented their products to more than 50 000 visitors.

To be honest, I was not aware of how many currently well-known tech companies were founded in France - to name a few [AppsFire](http://appsfire.com), [BlaBlaCar](http://www.blablacar.com), [Criteo](http://www.criteo.com), [Deezer](http://deezer.com), [DailyMotion](http://dailymotion.com), [Withings](https://health.nokia.com) and so on...

But there are also a plenty of new players - I found that especially hot topics are: connected things, makers / 3D printing, music and augmented reality (more precisely - software and accessories for <a href="http://www.oculusvr.com">Oculus Rift</a>).

## Internet of (Every)thing

It's clear that everything is better with Bluetooth! For me, the [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) section has been the most interesting part of the whole exhibition. I've seen there a lot of crazy (in a positive sense) ideas like:

* [Smoke Watchers](http://smoke-watchers.com) - an app that helps smokers to kick their habit using a smart e-cigarette (OK, I knew them before - we're creating an amazing app for them!)
* [Kolibree](https://www.kolibree.com) - world's first connected electric toothbrush
* [BioBot](http://www.kisskissbankbank.com/biobot)- connected interactive greenhouse
* [MEG](http://meg-live.com/index.php?id_lang=2) - the intelligent plant pot filled with lots of sensors
* [iMediPack](http://www.imedipac.com/imedipac.html) - smart pillbox, that remotely tracks your treatment

It came out that even if you're building a social network, you can have an interest in connected things:

* [Krak](http://skatekrak.com) - a social network for skaters, using sensors placed under the skateboard
* [YummyPets](http://www.yummypets.com) - social network for pets. Connected with a smart-collar of course

It's been an amazing digital festival (with an even better afterparty at magnificent venue of [La Gaîté lyrique](http://gaite-lyrique.net) :-) and my only one regret is that almost all of conferences/workshops/discussion panels have been held in French so I couldn't participate.
