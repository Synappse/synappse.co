      <description>iBeacons is that kind of technology that you have probably heard a lot but haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it in the real world at all. But there are many applications out there and in most cases, the majority of benefits are presented to people at the other end.
Every time you feel that you are guided inside buildings or it seems that you got super personalized, location-aware and just-in-time notification or suggestion in the app - you probably are looking at the effects of the iBeacons.</description>
