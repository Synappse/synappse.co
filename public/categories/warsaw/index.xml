      <description>Just a short note about my last weekend. I spent a great time at HACKWAW hackathon focused on Quantified Self movement. That was an amazing opportunity to met people not only from the tech industry but also to chat with mentors from the science world.
That was a truly amazing event — so many creative people, ideas and&amp;hellip; gadgets of course! The venue was fantastic, organizers did a great job. Ola, Kuba kudos for you!</description>
