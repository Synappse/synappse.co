On Saturday (November 30, 2013) had place a first of the series of preparation hackathons for the Jitter hackathon at [Mobile Central Europe](https://www.facebook.com/MCEConf/) conference. The Synappse Team went there to participate and make friends with this hackathon partner â€“ [Estimote](http://estimote.com).

## Task

The idea was to get familiar with [iBeacons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon) technology which is why Estimote prepared some presentation and had someone on the side to help with technical issues.

The target for us was to implement iBeacon region monitoring into our app Neon Muzeum which was sent to the App Store review another day. We are hoping you all will be able to see it in action on Monday (9th December 2013) at the one and only [Warsaw Neon Muzeum](http://www.neonmuzeum.org).
