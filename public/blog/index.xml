      <description>iBeacons is that kind of technology that you have probably heard a lot but haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it in the real world at all. But there are many applications out there and in most cases, the majority of benefits are presented to people at the other end.
Every time you feel that you are guided inside buildings or it seems that you got super personalized, location-aware and just-in-time notification or suggestion in the app - you probably are looking at the effects of the iBeacons.</description>

      <description>A while ago I&amp;rsquo;ve started working on a product that needed a multiplatform desktop app. I choose JavaFX as due to my research it will work the best with the other tools and frameworks that are necessary for this project.
Task In this post, I will show you how to build a custom vertical tab bar with icons using JFXTabPane. Our main goal over here is to create a side menu with 1 tab being single state logout button.</description>

      <title>Introducing Apple&#39;s Swift for iOS</title>
      <link>https://synappse.co/blog/introducing-apple-swift-for-ios/</link>

      <guid>https://synappse.co/blog/introducing-apple-swift-for-ios/</guid>
      <description>Swift was introduced on WWDC by Apple as a new programming language for iOS and OS X. Apple claims that it&amp;rsquo;s much faster than Objective-C and has better syntax but let&amp;rsquo;s get deeper into it and judge for ourselves. Official apple note:
Swift is an innovative new programming language for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. Writing code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and apps run lightning-fast. Swift is ready for your next iOS and OS X project — or for addition into your current app — because Swift code works side-by-side with Objective-C.</description>

      <title>Showing map preview with MKMapSnapshotter</title>
      <link>https://synappse.co/blog/showing-map-preview-with-mkmapsnapshotter/</link>

      <guid>https://synappse.co/blog/showing-map-preview-with-mkmapsnapshotter/</guid>
      <description>Working with MapKit can be tricky but if you just need a preview of the map then MKMapSnapshotter comes with a helping hand.
MKMapSnapshotter which was introduced in iOS7 can not only simplify the code you are using to show some place&amp;rsquo;s location but also will greatly improve performance.
For more information on how and when to use MKMapSnapshotter take a look at WWDC 2013 Session 309: “Putting Map Kit in Perspective”.</description>

      <title>UIScrollView has an ambiguous scrollable content height</title>

      <guid>https://synappse.co/blog/uiscrollview-has-ambiguous-scrollable-content-height/</guid>
      <description>This error showed to us by XCode means in plain English that scroll view is not able to determine its height (or width) using autolayout. There is a very simple solution to this problem and I will walk you thru it.
Our goal To illustrate how properly use scroll view with autolayout we will build a simple UIViewController with potentially (dynamically loaded) long text and button at the end of the view.</description>

      <description>On Saturday (November 30, 2013) had place a first of the series of preparation hackathons for the Jitter hackathon at Mobile Central Europe conference. The Synappse Team went there to participate and make friends with this hackathon partner – Estimote.
Task The idea was to get familiar with iBeacons technology which is why Estimote prepared some presentation and had someone on the side to help with technical issues.
The target for us was to implement iBeacon region monitoring into our app Neon Muzeum which was sent to the App Store review another day.</description>

      <title>Unlimited vacation vs Productivity</title>

      <description>There is a tenuous balance that every business organization must face—a positive and relaxing work culture and the need to maximize productivity. Some companies, particularly the more established ones, tend to forego developing a positive work culture altogether and simply expect employees to be the henchmen of the management’s will. This state of affairs is naturally demotivating and these companies have seen a dip in their productivity related to that. Now that even the most ardent Old School businessmen and women are coming to grips with the benefits of a positive work culture, they are left with the challenge of figuring out how to design a maximally productive one.</description>

      <description>Seems that we&amp;rsquo;ve liked Paris. It&amp;rsquo;s shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a surprise since in many different ways it&amp;rsquo;s a very cool city: one of the biggest startup community in Europe (as seen in a short relation from Futur en Seine, global center of world high culture with multitude of museums and art galleries and finally - a wonderful city in itself.
A few weeks ago we&amp;rsquo;ve had yet another opportunity to visit Paris - this time we&amp;rsquo;ve participated in the workshops organized by Europeana Foundation which runs Europeana.</description>

      <description>At Synappse we&amp;rsquo;re not only about creating stunning apps&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;re also very interested in new technologies and start-up ecosystem, so we need to keep an eye on this field. Besides everyday lecture of The Verge, from time to time it&amp;rsquo;s good to attend industry events, touch some amazing technologies and meet people face-to-face.
In the middle of June, I had an opportunity to visit Paris and see what&amp;rsquo;s happening in local startups on the Futur en Seine event, where for 4 days over 100 exhibitors at Innovation Village presented their products to more than 50 000 visitors.</description>

      <title>UPC Think Big Final Gala 2014</title>

      <description>On the 22nd of the January, we have been a part UPC Think Big final gala which featured 10 of the contest finalists. We&amp;rsquo;ve been given an opportunity to bring closer our idea to the judges and answer their questions after 3min pitch.
Unfortunately we didn&amp;rsquo;t win but we had a great occasion to test our presentation skills and to check if this particular audience will know more about iBeacon technology - the answer apparently is not so much, more and more people start to know something or just they heard about Estimote company but still the understanding of iBeacons technology is very basic.</description>

      <description>Just a short note about my last weekend. I spent a great time at HACKWAW hackathon focused on Quantified Self movement. That was an amazing opportunity to met people not only from the tech industry but also to chat with mentors from the science world.
That was a truly amazing event — so many creative people, ideas and&amp;hellip; gadgets of course! The venue was fantastic, organizers did a great job. Ola, Kuba kudos for you!</description>
