      <description>Working with MapKit can be tricky but if you just need a preview of the map then MKMapSnapshotter comes with a helping hand.
MKMapSnapshotter which was introduced in iOS7 can not only simplify the code you are using to show some place&amp;rsquo;s location but also will greatly improve performance.
For more information on how and when to use MKMapSnapshotter take a look at WWDC 2013 Session 309: “Putting Map Kit in Perspective”.</description>
