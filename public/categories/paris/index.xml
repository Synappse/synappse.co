      <description>Seems that we&amp;rsquo;ve liked Paris. It&amp;rsquo;s shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a surprise since in many different ways it&amp;rsquo;s a very cool city: one of the biggest startup community in Europe (as seen in a short relation from Futur en Seine, global center of world high culture with multitude of museums and art galleries and finally - a wonderful city in itself.
A few weeks ago we&amp;rsquo;ve had yet another opportunity to visit Paris - this time we&amp;rsquo;ve participated in the workshops organized by Europeana Foundation which runs Europeana.</description>

      <description>At Synappse we&amp;rsquo;re not only about creating stunning apps&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;re also very interested in new technologies and start-up ecosystem, so we need to keep an eye on this field. Besides everyday lecture of The Verge, from time to time it&amp;rsquo;s good to attend industry events, touch some amazing technologies and meet people face-to-face.
In the middle of June, I had an opportunity to visit Paris and see what&amp;rsquo;s happening in local startups on the Futur en Seine event, where for 4 days over 100 exhibitors at Innovation Village presented their products to more than 50 000 visitors.</description>
