      <description>Swift was introduced on WWDC by Apple as a new programming language for iOS and OS X. Apple claims that it&amp;rsquo;s much faster than Objective-C and has better syntax but let&amp;rsquo;s get deeper into it and judge for ourselves. Official apple note:
Swift is an innovative new programming language for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch. Writing code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and apps run lightning-fast. Swift is ready for your next iOS and OS X project — or for addition into your current app — because Swift code works side-by-side with Objective-C.</description>

      <description>Working with MapKit can be tricky but if you just need a preview of the map then MKMapSnapshotter comes with a helping hand.
MKMapSnapshotter which was introduced in iOS7 can not only simplify the code you are using to show some place&amp;rsquo;s location but also will greatly improve performance.
For more information on how and when to use MKMapSnapshotter take a look at WWDC 2013 Session 309: “Putting Map Kit in Perspective”.</description>
