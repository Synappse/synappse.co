Just a short note about my last weekend. I spent a great time at [HACKWAW](http://hackwaw.com) hackathon focused on [Quantified Self](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self) movement. That was an amazing opportunity to met people not only from the tech industry but also to chat with mentors from the science world.

That was a truly amazing event — so many creative people, ideas and... gadgets of course! The venue was fantastic, organizers did a great job. [Ola](https://twitter.com/olasitarska), [Kuba](https://twitter.com/83TB) kudos for you! I hope that we'll see you again at [Maker Land](http://www.makerland.org).

Just to mention - our hackathon team ([Adam](https://twitter.com/banaszekdesign) - graphics, [Magda](https://twitter.com/mchyzynska) - UX, [Andrzej](https://twitter.com/apragacz) - backend, Krzysztof - Android app and [me](https://twitter.com/wzs) - iOS app) has won the best app design award. **LifeGrid** app allows you to quantify yourself by tracking and categorizing your daily activities collected with the help of precise iBeacon micro-location and/or traditional GPS geolocation. Afterward, it'll visualize aggregated data in a stunning form - just take a look at our [final presentation](http://speakerdeck.com/wzs/lifegrid-track-and-visualise-your-daily-activities). I can assure you, that I'll continue to work on this project.
